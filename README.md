Done:
1. Randomize position at each rounds
2. set the payoff
   
Remain to-do:
1. Introduction part: explain the rule carefully
2. Set player payoff reasonably: repeat for 2/3 rounds and then change the payoff, repeat
3. Haven't consider the order of the sequence when calculating the payoff, --> need to change to only the first person who reject can get the benefit
4. Only show the result at the end of 5 rounds.
5. Embellish the interface.
