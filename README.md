Done:
1. Randomize position at each rounds
2. set the payoff
3. set_payoff: Only the first person who reject can get the benefit
4. Only show the result page at the end of 5 rounds.
   
Remain to-do:
1. Introduction part: explain the rule carefully, highlight
2. Set player payoff reasonably: repeat for 2/3 rounds and then change the payoff, repeat
3. Embellish the interface.
4. Design Result page
5. Make the players remain in the same group for all the rounds, might need to change the randomize function.
